# MaskGPT ðŸ”’
A privacy-first browser extension to mask sensitive data like passwords, tokens, and API keys **before they reach LLMs** like ChatGPT(Now only GPT).


## What it does

MaskGPT automatically detects and **masks sensitive information** (e.g., `pwd: mypassword`, `API_KEY=...`, `Authorization: Bearer ...`) 

###  Supported data types:
- API keys (`sk-...`, `AKIA...`, `API_KEY=...`)
- Tokens (`access_token=...`, `Authorization: Bearer ...`)
- Environment variables (`DB_PASS=...`, `.env` style)

---

## Example

When you **paste** something like:

```
pwd: supersecret123
API_KEY=sk-abc123def456
Authorization: Bearer xyz987.token
```

MaskGPT instantly rewrites it into:

```
pwd: [MASKED]
API_KEY=[MASKED]
Authorization: Bearer [MASKED]
````


##  Installation

### 1. Clone or download the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MaskGPT.git
````

### 2. Open Chrome and go to:

```
chrome://extensions/
```

* Enable **Developer mode**
