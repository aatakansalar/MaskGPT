Privacy Policy – MaskGPT

Effective Date: 25/06/2025

MaskGPT is a local-first, open-source Chrome extension that masks sensitive data (such as API keys, passwords, and tokens) from clipboard input before it is pasted into websites or AI systems. This privacy policy outlines how MaskGPT respects and protects your data.

1. No Data Collection
MaskGPT does not collect, transmit, store, or share any data — personal or otherwise. It operates fully within your browser, and no information is ever sent to external servers.

2. Local Processing Only
All processing occurs entirely within your browser's memory at runtime. MaskGPT observes clipboard content only at the moment a user initiates a paste action, applies masking rules in real time, and never retains or logs the data afterward.
There is no persistent storage, no local database, and no logging mechanism.

3. No Network Activity
The extension does not make any network requests, does not include any analytics, telemetry, or API calls. It is fully offline and self-contained.

4. No User Identification
There are no user accounts, tracking IDs, cookies, or session data. MaskGPT never attempts to identify users or devices in any way.

5. No Browser Storage
MaskGPT does not use any browser storage APIs such as localStorage, sessionStorage, IndexedDB, or extension storage. The application state exists only in memory during runtime and resets immediately afterward.

6. Open Source and Transparent
The complete source code is published and auditable at [GitHub Repository URL]. Anyone is free to inspect the code and verify its behavior. Contributions are welcome, provided they maintain the privacy-first architecture.

If you have questions or concerns, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.

MaskGPT is built with one principle: what happens in your clipboard stays on your device.
